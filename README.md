# Credit Card Fraud Detection

The detection of fraudulent Credit Card Transactions is a critical problem that affects the profitability and sustainability of Finance (Banking) companies. This study focuses on developing an effective Credit Card fraud detection model using supervised machine learning algorithms with ensemble learning methods. The objective is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent Credit Card Transactions while minimizing false positives. The model employs various supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Ensemble Learning Methods such as Bagging and Boosting. This study uses a real-world Credit Card Fraud Transactions dataset to evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than individual Machine Learning Algorithms. This study contributes to the development of effective fraud detection models that can assist Financial companies in detecting fraudulent Transactions, improving profitability and sustainability, and safeguarding the interests of honest Credit Card Holders.
